# PDF QA System with AWS Bedrock

Developed an intelligent PDF query system using AWS Bedrock and FAISS. This project involves creating a tool that allows users to interact with and query PDF documents through a Streamlit interface. Implemented advanced text embeddings and vector search capabilities to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user questions. The system utilizes AWS Bedrock for natural language processing and FAISS for efficient vector-based document retrieval.



##  Features

**PDF Loading**: Load and process PDF documents.
- **Text Embeddings**: Use AWS Bedrock to generate embeddings for document content.
- **Vector Search**: Implement vector-based search with FAISS for efficient querying.
- **Interactive Interface**: Build a Streamlit app for user interaction and query submission.
